# Mindmesh

An experimental project where multiple AI agents engage in self-dialogue, transforming an initial input prompt into something more complex / insightful.

## Features
*Multi-AI Collaboration*: Multiple AI agents engage in self-initiated conversations.

*Iterative Prompt Enhancement*: System transforms initial prompts into richer outputs over time.

*Research-Oriented*: Provides insights into AI-based creativity and conversational dynamics.

## Installation
To run this project locally, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

- [Ollama](www.ollama.com/)
- Choose a model of your choice. `It's Recommended to use llama2-uncensored`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mindmesh.git
cd mindmesh
```

Usage
- run `ollama serve` on both the server and client devices
- on one device, run the `server.py` and `client.py` in the other

Start by providing an initial prompt.
The AIs will engage in conversation, building on each otherâ€™s ideas.
Watch the output evolve as the conversation progresses.
Analyze the final result, comparing it to the initial input to observe the changes and improvements.

Contribution
This project is a work in progress, and contributions are welcome! Whether it's improving the AI models, adding new features, or enhancing the documentation, feel free to create a pull request or submit an issue.
